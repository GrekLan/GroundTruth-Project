🚀 TrendSpotter: The Automated Insight Engine

Tagline: An event-driven data pipeline that converts raw CSV logs into executive-ready PDF reports with AI-generated narratives in under 30 seconds.

## 1. The Problem (Real World Scenario)

Context: During my research into AdTech workflows, I identified a major inefficiency: Account Managers waste 4-6 hours every week manually downloading CSVs and taking screenshots to create "Weekly Performance Reports."

The Pain Point: This manual process is slow, boring, and error-prone. If a campaign is wasting budget, the client might not know for days because the reporting lag is too high.

My Solution: I built TrendSpotter, an event-driven system. You simply drop a raw file into a folder, and 30 seconds later, you receive a fully analyzed, executive-ready PDF report in your email.

## 2. Expected End Result

For the User:

Input: Drop a raw CSV file into the folder.

Action: Wait 30 seconds.

Output: Receive a professionally formatted PDF via email containing:

* Week-over-Week growth charts.
* A list of detected anomalies (e.g., "Traffic dropped 40% in Miami").
* An AI-written paragraph explaining why the drop happened (correlated with Weather API).

## 3. Technical Approach

I wanted to challenge myself to build a system that is Production-Ready, moving beyond simple scripts to a robust ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline.

System Architecture:

* Ingestion (Event-Driven): A Python watchdog script listens for file changes in real-time.
* Decision: I chose Pandas for data processing because of its robust ecosystem and ease of integration with ML libraries like Scikit-Learn.
* Anomaly Detection: I implemented the Isolation Forest algorithm (Scikit-Learn) to mathematically identify "weird" data points (outliers) rather than just using hard-coded if/else rules.
* Generative AI (The Analyst): We pass the anomaly metadata to Google Gemini 1.5 Pro. We use a Few-Shot Prompt technique to force the AI to sound like a Senior Data Analyst.
* Guardrail: I implemented a validation step to ensure the AI's math matches the Pandas dataframe to prevent hallucinations.
* Reporting: WeasyPrint renders the final HTML/CSS report into a pixel-perfect PDF.

## 4. Tech Stack

* Language: Python 3.11
* Data Engine: Pandas (Python Data Analysis Library)
* Machine Learning: Scikit-Learn (Isolation Forest)
* AI Model: Google Gemini 1.5 Pro (via Vertex AI)
* Orchestration: Docker & Docker Compose
* Visualization: Plotly & WeasyPrint

## 5. Challenges & Learnings

This project wasn't easy. Here are two major hurdles I overcame:

Challenge 1: AI Hallucinations

Issue: Initially, the AI would invent reasons for data drops (e.g., claiming "It rained" when I provided no weather data).

Solution: I implemented a "Strict Context" System Prompt. I effectively told the AI: "Only use the data provided in the JSON context. If you don't know, say 'Unknown'." This reduced hallucination rates significantly.

Challenge 2: Docker Networking

Issue: My Python container couldn't send emails out to the SMTP server.

Solution: I learned about Docker Networks and container isolation. I had to configure the SMTP ports and environment variables correctly in the docker-compose.yml to allow external traffic.

## 7. How to Run

```bash
# 1. Clone Repository
git clone https://github.com/GrekLan/GroundTruth-Project.git

# 2. Add API Key
export GEMINI_API_KEY="your_key_here"

# 3. Build & Run Container
docker-compose up --build

# 4. Test
# Move the sample.csv to the input folder to trigger the pipeline
mv data/sample.csv data/input/
```
